### Changing the WooCoommerce Bookings *read more* button

You probably don't want the *read more* button on your bookable products. Neither do we! It doesn't make sense.

You can now change the buttons to something more useful to your customers, like **Book Now**, or **View Dates**.

Our Button Customizer also supports WooCommerce Bookings accommodation products where buttons like **Book Nights** make more sense.
